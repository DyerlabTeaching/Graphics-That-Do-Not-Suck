# Graphics that Don't Suck

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DyerlabTeaching/Graphics-That-Do-Not-Suck/main/media/graphics.png)

## Impetus

This is a slightly larger topic because it emcompasses both classic graphics in `R` as well as graphics via `ggplot2`.

## Student Learning Objectives

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:   
 - Create both univariate and bivariate plots of data using continuous and categorical data types.  
 - Customize symbologies for data representation based upon properties intrinsic to the data.  
 - Apply the use of colors to make data better represented.  

## Content

This topic has the following content:

 - Slides for [classic plotting](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Graphics-That-Do-Not-Suck/slides_classic.html) and for [ggplot2](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Graphics-That-Do-Not-Suck/slides.html) plotting.
 - The narrative for both [classic plotting](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Graphics-That-Do-Not-Suck/narrative_classic.html) as well as for [ggplot2](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Graphics-That-Do-Not-Suck/narrative.html) graphics
