## Impetus

This is a slightly larger topic because it emcompasses both classic graphics in `R` as well as graphics via `ggplot2`.

## Student Learning Objectives

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:   
 - Create both univariate and bivariate plots of data using continuous and categorical data types.  
 - Customize symbologies for data representation based upon properties intrinsic to the data.  
 - Apply the use of colors to make data better represented.
