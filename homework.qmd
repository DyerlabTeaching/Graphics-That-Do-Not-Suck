## The Data

Let's start by playing around with some of the [Rice Rivers Center](https://ricerivers.vcu.edu) data from the script *you wrote* in a previous exercise (I am assuming it is in your current course repository directory).

In the following examples, I will ask for graphical output from a pair of data sources.  Use *both* classic and ggplot approaches to construct plots.  You can decide on how to display the data, choose a visualization style that is most informative for each graphic.

1. Total Rain for Each Weekday in January.  
2. Average daily temperature for weekdays in February.
3. Water depth on valentines day.
4. Scatter plot of Daily Total Rain and Daily Median Temperature grouped by month (label the centroid of months).
5. Wind Direction during the week containing the 8th of January.
